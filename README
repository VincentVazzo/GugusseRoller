The GugusseGUI software for the Gugusse Roller
Author: Denis-Carl Robidoux

The Gugusse Roller is a DIY project to make a machine that can
transfer films of all sizes between 8mm (included) and 35mm
(included) to digital. It comprises of:
    - 3D printed parts
    - A Raspberry Pi 4B (with 4GB)
    - A Raspberry Pi HQ camera
    - An Adafruit Metro Mini 5V 16Mhz (it's an Arduino)
    - 3 stepper motors (bipolar 12V Nema 17, 34mm height)
    - A longboard wheel
    - Various small electronic parts.
    - A reliable 5V and 12V power supply
    - Led strips

You can find all the instructions, the files to make your 3D
printed parts and the one to make the PCB for free, no strings
attached, at www.deniscarl.com

DEPENDENCIES:
  - installable by raspbian's apt-get:
      - python3-pil
      - python3-picamera
      - python3-rpi.gpio
      - python3-dev
      - git
      - nano (you might need an editor for the first time you run it)
      - imagemagick
      - python3-numpy
      - python3-exif
      - jq
  - found on Github:
      - schoolpost/PiDNG (used to be called schoolpost/PyDNG)
      
The resulting machine is fully functionnal and stable but it
is still evolving. You can watch or participate this evolution at

The objectives of the software is to:
    - Drive the 3 stepper motors
    - Monitor the camera's output
    - Adjust the various camera settings
    - read the 3 discrete inputs:
         1. film hole detector
         2. left arm aligned in middle
         3. right arm aligned in middle
    - capture each frame, save it as jpeg (or better as a 12bits raw DNG)
    - transfer the file to a ftp server
